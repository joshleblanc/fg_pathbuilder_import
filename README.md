# fg_pathbuilder_import

Create a data folder (or just copy the whole project folder) in the Fantasy Ground  extensions folder (on windows, it's under c:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Smiteworks\Fantasy Grounds\extensions


Launch Fantasy Grounds

Enable the extension for your test campaign

Once the campaign is loaded, you can run the importer by using /impb on the console.  This pops up a window and you can paste the Pathbuilder JSON in and click the button to parse it.  It will add the created character to the "Character Selection Window".

You should load all the resources that you'll need to use, so if you need Secrets of Magic, you'll want that loaded.  At the very least you need the CRB loaded.
